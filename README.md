# Introduction
This exercise guides you through implementing a decision tree algorithm and applying it to a dataset of mushrooms. The goal is to classify mushrooms as either edible or poisonous based on their features.

# Packages
Before starting, ensure you have all the necessary packages installed. This project requires:

1. NumPy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

# Problem Statement
The primary objective is to build a decision tree classifier that can accurately determine if a mushroom is safe to eat based on its characteristics.

# Dataset
The dataset comprises various features of mushrooms, one-hot encoded for easier processing. You'll explore the dataset, understand its structure, and prepare it for the decision tree algorithm.

# One Hot Encoded Dataset
A detailed explanation of how the dataset is one-hot encoded and its implications on the decision tree's performance.

# Decision Tree Refresher
A brief refresher on decision trees, covering essential concepts like entropy, information gain, and dataset splitting.

1. Calculate Entropy
2. Split Dataset
3. Calculate Information Gain
4. Get Best Split
.\ Each section contains exercises to implement parts of the decision tree algorithm.

# Building the Tree
Guidance on combining the components developed in the previous sections to build a full decision tree.

# Data Exploration
Tips on getting familiar with your dataset, including viewing variables and checking the dimensions of your data.
